fix: Resolve CORS issue by implementing optional authentication

- Changed filings list endpoint to use optional authentication
- Changed companies endpoints to use optional authentication
- Fixed Pydantic validation error - company field expects dict not object
- Added global exception handlers to ensure CORS headers on errors

Known issue:
- Multiple companies showing identical 10-Q data (UAL, TRV)
- Likely caused by AI processing template pollution or caching issues
- Requires investigation and fix in next iteration

TODO: Fix duplicate filing data issue before production release
